                    7.2 Please note that sub-Clause 7.1 does not exclude Our
                    responsibility for mistakes due to negligence on Our part

                    remove special offers from time to time and as necessary.
                    All pricing information is reviewed and updated from time to
                    time at our sole discretion. Changes in price will not
                    affect any Order that you have already placed (please note

                    information, We will contact you in writing before
                    proceeding with your Order to inform you of the mistake and
                    to ask you how you wish to proceed. We will give you the
                    option to purchase the Services at the correct price or to
                    cancel your Order (or the affected part thereof). We will

                    treat your Order as cancelled and notify you of the same in

                    changes between your Order being placed and Us processing
                    that Order and taking payment, you will be charged the price
                    shown on Our Site at the time of placing your Order.

                  <span className="pding-l1">
                    10.1 As required by law, We will provide the Services with
                    reasonable skill and care, consistent with best practices
                    and standards in the e-commerce supply of services sector,
                    and in accordance with any information provided by Us about
                    the Services and about Us. We will begin providing the
                    Services on the date agreed when you make your Order (which
                    We shall confirm in the Order Confirmation). Please note
                    that if you request that the Services begin within the legal
                    14 calendar day cancellation (or “cooling off”) period, your
                    right to cancel may be limited or lost. Please refer to
                    Clauses 11 and 12 for more details on your cancellation
                    rights, including the cooling off period. We will use all
                    reasonable endeavours to provide the Services with
                    reasonable skill and care, commensurate with best trade
                    practice.
                    <br></br>
                    10.2 We will continue providing the Services until the
                    estimated completion date set out in the Order Confirmation.
                    <br></br>
                    10.3 We will make every reasonable effort to provide the
                    Services in a timely manner and to complete them on time. We
                    cannot, however, be held responsible for any delays if an
                    event outside of Our control occurs. Please refer to Clause
                    16 for events outside of Our control.
                    <br></br>
                    10.4 If We require any information or action from you in
                    order to provide the Services, We will inform you of this as
                    soon as is reasonably possible. Depending upon the nature of
                    the Services you have ordered, We may require information or
                    action such as confirmations of parties’ names, address, and
                    medical information in relation to disabilities and
                    allergies.
                    <br></br>
                    10.5 If the information you provide or the action you take
                    under sub-Clause 10.4 is delayed, incomplete or otherwise
                    incorrect, We will not be responsible for any delay caused
                    as a result. If additional work is required from Us to
                    correct or compensate for a mistake made as a result of
                    delayed, incomplete or otherwise incorrect information or
                    action that you have provided or taken, We may charge you a
                    reasonable additional sum for that work.
                    <br></br>
                    10.6 In certain circumstances, for example where there is a
                    delay in you sending Us information or taking action
                    required under sub-Clause 10.4, We may suspend the Services
                    (and will inform you of that suspension by email.)
                    <br></br>
                    10.7 In certain circumstances, for example where We
                    encounter a technical problem, We may need to suspend or
                    otherwise interrupt the Services to resolve the issue.
                    Unless the issue is an emergency that requires immediate
                    action We will inform you in advance by telephone and/or
                    email before suspending or interrupting the Services.
                    <br></br>
                    10.8 If the Services are suspended or interrupted under
                    sub-Clauses 10.6, or 10.7 you will not be required to pay
                    for them during the period of suspension. You must, however,
                    pay any sums that may already be due by the appropriate due
                    date(s).
                    <br></br>
                    10.9 If you do not pay Us for the Services as required by
                    Clause 9, We may suspend the Services until you have paid
                    any and all outstanding sums due. If this happens, we will
                    inform you by email.

                  <span className="pding-l1">
                    11.1 As a “consumer”, you have a legal right to a
                    “cooling-off” period within which you can cancel the
                    Contract for any reason. This period begins once your Order
                    is accepted and We have sent you an Order Confirmation,
                    i.e., when the Contract between you and Us is formed. The
                    period ends at the end of 14-calendar days after that date.
                    <br></br>
                    11.2 If you wish to exercise your right to cancel under this
                    Clause 11, you must inform Us of your decision within the
                    cooling off period. You may do so in any way you wish,
                    however for your convenience. Cancellation by email or by
                    post is effective from the date on which you send Us your
                    message. Please note that the cooling off period lasts for
                    whole calendar days. If, for example, you send Us an email
                    or letter by 23:59 on the final day of the cooling off
                    period, your cancellation will be valid and accepted. If you

                    11.4 As specified in sub-Clause 10.1, if the Services are to
                    begin within the cooling off period you are required to make
                    an express request to that effect. [This request forms a
                    normal part of the order process.] By requesting that the
                    Services begin within the 14-calendar day cooling off period
                    you acknowledge and agree to the following:
                    <br></br>
                    11.4.1 If the Services are fully performed within the
                    14-calendar day cooling off period, you will lose your right
                    to cancel after the Services are complete.
                    <br></br>
                    11.4.2 If you cancel after provision of the Services has
                    begun but is not yet complete you will still be required to
                    pay for the Services provided up until the point at which
                    you inform Us that you wish to cancel. The amount due shall
                    be calculated in proportion to the full price of the
                    Services and the actual Services already provided. Any sums
                    that have already been paid for the Services shall be
                    refunded subject to deductions calculated in accordance with
                    the foregoing. Refunds, where applicable, will be issued
                    within 14-calendar days after you inform Us that you wish to
                    cancel. Refunds will be made using the same payment method
                    you used when ordering the Services unless you specifically
                    request that We make a refund using a different method and
                    we agree to it.

                    in writing; or

                    12.4.2 We go into liquidation or have a receiver or

                    12.4.4 We are adversely affected by an event outside of Our

                    12.5 Eligibility for refunds may vary according to the

                    any refund due to you or, if no refund is due, We will

                    13.2 We may cancel the Services after We have begun
                    providing them due to an Event outside of Our control that
                    continues for more than 3-months (as under sub-Clause
                    16.2.4), or due to the non-availability of required
                    personnel and/or required materials necessary for the
                    provision of the Services. In such cases, you will only be

                    up until the point at which We inform you that We are

                    14-calendar days written notice of such cancellation. You
                    will only be required to pay for Services that you have
                    received. Such sums will be deducted from any refund due to
                    you or, if no refund is due, We will invoice you for the
                    relevant sums.

                    13.4 Refunds due under this Clause 13 will be issued to you

                    in Clause 9. This does not affect Our right to charge you
                    interest on any overdue sums as set out in sub-Clause 9.4;
                    or

                    fault. If We determine that a problem has been caused by

                    14.4 As a consumer, you have certain legal rights with
                    respect to the purchase of services. For full details of
                    your legal rights and guidance on exercising them, it is
                    recommended that you contact your local Citizens Advice or
                    Trading Standards Office. If We do not perform the Services
                    with reasonable skill and care, you have the right to
                    request repeat performance or, if that is not possible or
                    done within a reasonable time without inconvenience to you,
                    you have the right to a reduction in price. If the Services
                    are not performed in line with information that We have
                    provided about them, you also have the right to request
                    repeat performance or, if that is not possible or done
                    within a reasonable time without inconvenience to you (or if
                    Our breach concerns information about Us that does not
                    relate to the performance of the Services), you have the
                    right to a reduction in price. If for any reason We are
                    required to repeat the Services in accordance with your
                    legal rights, We will not charge you for the same and We
                    will bear any and all costs of such repeat performance. In
                    cases where a price reduction applies, this may be any sum
                    up to the full Price and, where you have already made
                    payment(s) to Us, may result in a full or partial refund.
                    Any such refunds will be issued without undue delay (and in
                    any event within 14 calendar days starting on the date on
                    which We agree that you are entitled to the refund) and made
                    via the same payment method originally used by you unless
                    you request an alternative method, and we agree to this. In
                    addition to your legal rights relating directly to the
                    Services, you also have remedies if We use materials that
                    are faulty or incorrectly described.

                  these Terms of Sale (and under the Contract, as applicable) to

                  applicable) without Our express written permission.
                  <br></br>
                  20.3 The Contract is between you and Us. It is not intended to
                  benefit any other person or third party in any way and no such
                  person or party will be entitled to enforce any provision of

                  <br></br>
                  20.4 The Contract between you and Us is only in relation to
                  Our online services sending “virtual” invitations to your
                  wedding events. We are not involved in the organisation of

                  hospitality, entertainment, and venue hire contracts necessary
                  to arrange these events. Such contracts are between you and
                  the individual suppliers of goods and services, and you must
                  seek redress from them if things go wrong with the

                  20.6 No failure or delay by Us in exercising any of Our rights
                  under these Terms of Sale means that We have waived that
                  right, and no waiver by Us of a breach of any provision of
